# üîß Fixes Applied - Session Summary

## Issue 1: Bad PDF Format ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
Generated PDFs had terrible formatting - lost all styling, fonts, layout from the original template.

### Root Cause
The old implementation:
- Extracted raw text from template
- Created a completely new PDF from scratch  
- Used basic Helvetica font, size 10
- No preservation of original formatting

### Solution
Completely rewrote the PDF handler using **PyMuPDF (fitz)**:
- Works directly with PDF structure
- Searches for placeholder positions
- Extracts and preserves font properties (name, size, color)
- Replaces text in-place while maintaining formatting
- Professional output that matches the template

### Changes Made
1. Added `PyMuPDF==1.23.8` to `requirements.txt`
2. Rewrote `app/pdf_handler.py` with proper formatting preservation
3. Tested and verified improved output

**Result:** PDFs now look professional and match the original template perfectly! üé®

## Issue 2: Nothing Saved to Google Sheets ‚úÖ IDENTIFIED & SOLUTION PROVIDED

### Problem
Contract submissions were not being saved to the Google Spreadsheet.

### Root Cause
The **service account doesn't have access** to the spreadsheet. Google Sheets require explicit sharing, even for service accounts.

### Solution
**Share the spreadsheet with the service account:**

```
contract-automation@vibrant-victory-455816-r5.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

### How to Fix

```bash
./setup_sheets.sh
```

4. Set permissions: **Editor**

6. Click "Share"

### Verification
After sharing, the app will show:
```
‚úÖ Google Sheets connected: [Your Sheet Name]
‚úÖ Saved to Google Sheets: [Student Name]
```

### Additional Improvements Made
