## 🎯 What's New

### Age Calculation & Auto-Fill System

#### ✨ Features
1. **Real-time age calculation** from birth date
2. **Visual age indicator** with color coding:
   - 🟢 Green badge: Student ≥ 14 (adult)
   - 🟡 Yellow badge: Student < 14 (minor)
3. **Smart auto-fill**:
   - Age ≥ 14: Contact name = Student name (auto-filled with blue highlight)
   - Age < 14: Under 14 section auto-filled, contact separate for parent
4. **Section management**:
   - Age ≥ 14: Under 14 section hidden/disabled
   - Age < 14: Under 14 section visible and active
5. **User override**: Can manually edit any auto-filled field

#### 🔄 User Flow Example

**Adult Student (16 years):**
```
1. Enter: "Ion Popescu", Birth: 2008-03-15
2. System shows: [Vârstă: 16 ani] 🟢
3. Auto-fills: Contact = "Ion Popescu" (blue highlight)
4. Hides: Under 14 section
5. User can: Override if needed
```

**Minor Student (12 years):**
```
1. Enter: "Maria Ionescu", Birth: 2012-08-20
2. System shows: [Vârstă: 12 ani] 🟡
3. Keeps: All sections visible
4. Auto-fills: Under 14 fields with student name
